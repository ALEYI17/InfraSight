# InfraSight

**InfraSight** is an observability and auditing platform that uses eBPF to capture low-level system events (like `execve`, `open`, `connect`, etc.) and stream them to a ClickHouse backend for high-performance analysis.

It helps platform engineers, SREs, and security teams gain deep visibility into workloads, processes, and container behavior â€” on Linux and Kubernetes alike.
