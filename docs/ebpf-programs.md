## ‚öôÔ∏è eBPF Programs and Attach Points

InfraSight uses a suite of eBPF programs to trace specific kernel-level events. Each program is attached to carefully chosen **tracepoints** or **kprobes** to monitor relevant syscall or kernel function activity.

### üîç Overview

| Program     | Attach Points                                         | Attach Type        | Description                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **execve**  | `sys_enter_execve`, `sys_exit_execve`                 | Tracepoint         | Traces process execution events, including command-line arguments and exit status |
| **open**    | `sys_enter_openat`, `sys_exit_openat`                 | Tracepoint         | Captures file open attempts, including accessed filename                          |
| **chmod**   | `sys_enter_fchmodat`, `sys_exit_fchmodat`             | Tracepoint         | Monitors changes to file permissions                                              |
| **accept**  | `inet_csk_accept` (entry and return)                  | kprobe / kretprobe | Captures accepted network connections (i.e., incoming TCP connections)            |
| **connect** | `tcp_v4_connect`, `tcp_v6_connect` (entry and return) | kprobe / kretprobe | Monitors outbound TCP connection attempts for both IPv4 and IPv6                  |
| **ptrace**  | `sys_enter_ptrace`, `sys_exit_ptrace`                 | Tracepoint         | Observes process tracing actions like `attach`, `peek`, `poke`, and `continue`; useful for detecting debuggers, tampering, or reverse engineering |
| **mmap**    | `sys_enter_mmap`, `sys_exit_mmap`                     | Tracepoint         | Tracks memory mapping requests, including suspicious RWX regions used in shellcode or injection attacks                                           |



### üß© Attach Types Explained

* **Tracepoint**: Static instrumentation points in the kernel. Safer and more stable across kernel versions. Used for syscalls like `execve`, `open`, `chmod`.
* **kprobe / kretprobe**: Dynamic probes on kernel functions. Used for networking-related functions like `inet_csk_accept` and `tcp_v*_connect`.

### üìÅ Program Location

Each eBPF program is written in C and located under the [`bpf/`](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf) directory of the `ebpf_loader` repository. Here are the links to each specific tracer:

* **[execve\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/execve_tracer)** ‚Äì Monitors process execution
* **[open\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/open_tracer)** ‚Äì Tracks file open activity
* **[chmod\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/chmod_tracer)** ‚Äì Observes permission changes
* **[accept\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/accept_tracer)** ‚Äì Hooks accepted TCP connections
* **[connect\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/connect_tracer)** ‚Äì Tracks outbound TCP connection attempts
* **[ptrace\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/ptrace_tracer)** ‚Äì Detects process tracing and debugging behavior such as `ptrace` attach, memory read/write, and syscall control
* **[mmap\_tracer](https://github.com/ALEYI17/ebpf_loader/tree/main/bpf/mmap_tracer)** ‚Äì Observes memory allocation via `mmap`; useful for detecting RWX mappings, shellcode injection, or memory-based exploits




These programs are compiled using **[`bpf2go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cilium/ebpf/cmd/bpf2go)**, a tool from the Cilium/ebpf project, which generates Go bindings for eBPF C code. The resulting artifacts are then loaded dynamically by the `ebpf_loader` agent at runtime.
